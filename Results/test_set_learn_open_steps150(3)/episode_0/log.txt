Changing event planner subgoal to: GET_CLOSE_AND_LOOK_AT_OPENABLE(CABINET_1)
WARNING: There are no feasible states to reach within a distance of 1.5 meters from the goalobject. This can be due to several reasons: the agent is holding an object which increase its encumbrance and collides during the path, or the topview is changed or (unlikely) the goal object position has been updated and moved to a not traversable grid cell.
